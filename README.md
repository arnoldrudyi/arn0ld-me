## Running the Application
1. Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install # or yarn
```

2. Start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev # or yarn run dev
```
This will run the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

3. Generate a full-static production build:

```sh
npm run build # or yarn run build
```
This will generate an optimized version of application for further production deployment.
